# Week 1
## Lab introduction


## Topics

- What a lab is? - History of lab?
- What are different machines ?
    - What are meant to achive?
- Magic machine workshop?
    - What ideal fancy machine

- History of food, future food
    What is normal food?


## What a lab is?

- In scifi lab is depicted as dark dirty mysterious place
    - In reality, it is bright and very clean place with lots of regulation

- lab is :  a standard environment/place that experiment could be done and repeated multiple times. Even if the location is different, as long as the required parameters for an experiment are true then the experiment could be repeated.

- DIY lab (things needed)
    - More cheaper equipments these days
    - Must have equipments and its goals
        1. Particle separation
            - Centrifuge : To seperate things
            - Gel electrophoresis : To seperate DNA
        2. Particle mixing
            - Shaker / Vortex : To mix things
        3. Measuring
            - Pipette : To measure tiny amount
            - Scale : To measure weight, volume, etc
            - Microscope : To observe microorganism
            - Spectophotometer : To measure the about of light photons absorbed after it passes through a liquid solution
            - Sequencer : To determine nucleic acid of DNA
            - HPLC (High performing liquid chromatography) : 
        4. Control environment
            - Autoclave : To clean everything we are using in lab. (It uses pressure to high temperature to that organism can't grow
            - Incubator : To store / culture an organism. (It maintains temperature , humidity, oxygen, content etc so organism could grow)
            - Freezer : To freeze organism
            - Sterile hood : To create sterile environment for experiment. (So no fungi or bacteria could enter the environment)
            - Biosafety cabinet : To create ventilated working space for experiment. (This usually used for safely working with pathogen)
            - PCR kit / Thermocycler : To rapidly make copies of DNA samples
            - Bioreactor : To make an environment that supports biologically active environment. (This is more advance version of incubator)
        5. Usables
            - glass containers
            - petri dish
            - pipetube
            - inoculation loops
    - What is equipment standards? (TLDR no)
    - How to prove no organism can escape a lab? (It is difficult to measure that. But according to WHO if you could decrease the probability of organism escaping the lab by factor of 1000 that it is OK)
    - MEMO : see page 5 on pdf

- What is wet lab?
    - Lab that is specialize to protect experiment from spillage etc

- Biosafety design
    1. Permanent structure. (So no minimalist furniture)
    2. All surface are easily cleanable and non absorbant. (So no wood, coz it could absorb )
    3. autoclave is necessary
    4. possibility to disinfect hands
    5. working clothes
    6. doors and window closed
    7. No other organism such as pet and plants
