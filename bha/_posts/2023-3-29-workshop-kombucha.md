# Kombucha workshop

Kombucha is healthy drink but it is really expensive

## What is kombucha?

You need scoby to make kombucha


SCOBY is Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria & Yeast

Misconception about scoby kombucha is that it cellulose mat that house bacteria and yeast cultures that turn tea into kombucha.

The cellulose mat is called pellicle.

Scoby is actually the whole liquid itself

### Process of making combucha
 
`Tea  + Sugar + SCOBY -> Yeast eats sugar and produce alcohol -> Alcohol tea -> Bacteria eats alcohol & produce acetic acid`-> Kombucha`


Making kombucha needs some nitrogen compound. So you could make kombucha with banana or mango too.


You could use store brought kombucha to make your own kombucha. But you need to be careful about store brought kombucha because sometimes they heat the kombucha before putting it in shelf.
