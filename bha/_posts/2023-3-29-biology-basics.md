# Growing life (Biology Basics)


## Concepts

In the past world:
	- People used to live with nature
	- Man are above all species (including woman)

In the modern world:
	- 50%~ of human population live in city (detach from nature)
	- Human are just one of the existing organism (We are not above them)


70% of oxygen in the world are produced by cyanobacteria. Misconception that oxygen are produce mostly by plants.


Microorganism are more diverse than macroorganism. Because microorganism needs to evolve million million years to produce a macroorganism.
So it is more diverse to pick random microbacteria DNA in your food, rather than organism such as tree and mushroom.


## Organism

The first time human realize that microorganim exist is because the invention of microscope.

Microscope is just a really really good lens.

Microorganism 
- Bacteria
- Fungi
	- Fungi is interesting because it breaks down cellulose
	- In the past, nothing breaks down cellulose. So tree feel down and decompose into other materials on earth.
	- This lets cellulose to convert to oil. And then when fungi exist, cellulose is decomposed and oil reserved is not produced.

Survival of the fittest make a super organism

Symbiosis between organism
- Lichen (Fungi and algae working together)
- Mitocondria (History: bacteria eats another bacteria and somehow bacteria eaten aren't killed and produce enery inside)
- Slime mold (Physarum polycephalum)
	- Collection of single cell organism that work together
	- Sometime the sacrifice themselves to make other cells grow
	- Sometime they make complex decision and show intelligence
