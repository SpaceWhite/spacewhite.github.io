First read the instruction on how to make agar on the back of the package

It is written there to make agar, you need to mix 1 pack (4g) of agar with 500ml water.


Since 500ml is too much to make medium, I cook it with 250ml water.

Make the first agar with strawberry jam, by mixing 50g of the jam to boiling water
And then pour it to the petri dish

Throw out the leftover, wash the pot and put again 250 ml water and boil it.

next, make the second agar with white bread, by mixing 2 pieces of bread.
the bread absorb too much water, so you need to mix it with a little bit of water around 250ml
and then drain it with collander and will get the starch liquid which is really gulpy
put the starch liquid into the pot again and this time mix it with 250ml of liquid and mix it with agar.
and then pour it to the petri dish.
