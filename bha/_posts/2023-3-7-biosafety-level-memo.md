Biosafety level
- How is biosafety level in Indonesia (Compare to other countries)
- How do they challenge concept of GMO
- Biosafety level international standard 
- When organism is transported to outside, then it will be different


Biosafety levels

United states:
    - Specified by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)


EU:
    - Specified by directive

Indonesia:
    - 


## IRL

### biosafety
- must kill bacteria if it is not used


### GMO law
- biosafety clearing house (BCH)
- Japan is using Cartagena protocol on biosafety https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety
- Gene  editing with permission vs not having permission (genome chirashi english)
- https://www.biodic.go.jp/bch/bch_8.html
- https://www.biodic.go.jp/bch/download/genome/genome_chirashi_english.pdf
- Gene drive (Gene modified mosquito)
- NBT breeding technology



GMO law in japan
- Cartagena law
- Food sanitation law (with 3 exceptions) Beloware the exceptions
    - self cloning
        - define what self cloning that is allowed?
        - For example : if 2 e coli with different DNA exchange DNA in the wild, And people try to do experiment those DNA exchanges of 2 e coli in the lab. It is not GMO
        - There are list of e coli of the combinations that is allowed
    - natural occurence
    - highly purified products


There are 2 types of generic : Transgenic and cistgenic

flower has mobile genetic element

90% of genome comesfrom retrovirus

What is GMO?
    Cell + Plasmid
    Heat the cell so that the membrane weaken
    the plasmid will enter cell
    plasmid will generate mrna inside cell


idea for labs:
- marie kondo robot
- remote cloud lab
- rental labs
- VR labs
- Simulating biology
