# Introduction to electronics

## Safety

- Electricity can be fatal
- Insulation
- Disconnect with power source before starting experiment
- Watchout for chemicals (Because electicity e.g battery is made with chemicals)


## Circuit

Current = Electron flow (Ampere unit)

Short circuit :
	- When there is no resistance pulling the electic flow and it will generate lots of heat.
	- This could caused for e.g battery to explode

Current flows from - to +

## Electrical components

### Power source

Power source with controllable power output

Measured in voltage

### Resistor

Resist current flow

Measured in ohm

Series resistor : `RTotal = R1 + R2 + ... Rn`

Paralllel resistor : `1/RTotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... 1/Rn`


### Diode

Allows current to pass through one direction


### Transformer

Transformers are used to change AC voltage levels, such transformers being termed step-up or step-down type to increase or decrease voltage level

Common e.g
- Microwave. To generate high voltage from low voltage

### Capacitor

Store and emits energy

Measured in Faraday (F)

### Transistor

Use to amplify current and switching current

mosfet transistor allow you to do switch current

### Integrated Circuit IC

Instead of building everything ourselves, we could use modularized circuit for our needs.

e.g of IC:
	- 555 Timer

## Circuit examples

###  Fan circuit


### Heat pad circuit

showcase of circuit that uses 555 timer, mosfet, potentiometer, resistor etc

### Microcontroller

used for rapid prototyping

circuit that could be programmed with IDE

e.g ardruino, beagle board etc
